# Charged Lepton Flavor Number Violation Project

Code and analysis tools developed during the **CERN Summer Student Program 2024** for analyzing particle collision data. This project focuses on analyzing both **generated** and **reconstructed** electron and muon data to illustrate different histograms such as:

- **Transverse momenta**
- **Pseudorapidity**
- **Phi angle**
- **Efficiency**

The analysis is performed using the **ROOT framework**, interfaced with **Python**, after extracting relevant data from `.root` files.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into **three parts**:

### 1. Drell-Yan Process and Z-Boson Mass Calculation
- Includes the study and analysis of the **Drell-Yan process**.
- Performs calculations of the **Z-boson mass**.

### 2. CLFV Analysis in Simulated and Reconstructed Data
- Applies the developed code to **simulated** and **reconstructed** data.
- Focuses on the analysis of **three tauon decays** that exhibit **Charged Lepton Flavor Violation (CLFV)**.

### 3. Future Work and CMS Data Exploration
- Extends the analysis to **CMS experimental data**.
- Investigates **tauon decays** that violate the **lepton flavor number conservation**.
