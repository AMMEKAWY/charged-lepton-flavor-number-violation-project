# charged-lepton-flavor-number-violation-project
Code and analysis tools developed during the CERN Summer Student Program 2024 for analyzing particle collision data, focusing on analysing both generated and reconstructed electron and muon to calculate illustrate different histograms like the transverse momenta, the pseudorapidity, the phi angle as well as efficiency using the ROOT framework interfaced using python, after extracting them from .root files.
==================
the project was separated into three parts: 
first part: included "Drell-Yan" process and its analysis, and the calculations of the Z-boson mass.
===================
second part: included the application of this code over simulated and reconstructed data of three tauon decays that follows the CLFV.
===================
third part: included "future work" on the analysis of CMS data, and looking for the tauon decays that violates the conservation of the lepton flavour number.
